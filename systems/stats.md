## Charisma Proxy##

The concept is that charisma is a more fluid system where the strengths and weaknesses of the 'charisma stat' is dependant on the primary stat presented by the subject rather than a single charisma stat.  An example would be a fighter with high strength is going to be more charasmatic to a barbarian with high strength while a high finesse rogue would be less likely to win over the same barbarian and an int character would have nothing in common at all and would have very little chance having a positive interaction with the barbarian.   This concept is to remove the unspoken role of requiring a party "face" to deal with social interactions and allows character steriotypes that would usually be low con to contribute to RP moments in meaningful ways
