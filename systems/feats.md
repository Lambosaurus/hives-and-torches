# Feats

Feats are improvements to your character. An additional feat can be selected each [level](stats.md#level).

Characters also start with 2 feats as part of their [background](#backgrounds).

Feats are broken into two categories:
 - [General feats](#general-feats)
 - [Archetype feats](#archetype-feats)

# General feats
General feats have no prerequsities (with some exceptions).
These represents options available to all characters.

These are broken down further into:
 - [basic feats](feats/basic.md)
 - [weapon feats](feats/weapons.md)
 - [combat feats](feats/combat.md)

# Archetype feats
Archetypes replace the classes found in most other systems. 

Archetype feats usually have a common prerequsite (usually the first feat listed in the archetype).
This feat acts as a 'buy in' to the archetype.
You may take feats from as many archetypes as you wish.

The following archetypes are available:
 - [barbarian](feats/barbarian.md)
 - [rogue](feats/rogue.md)

# Backgrounds
