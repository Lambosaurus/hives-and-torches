# Divine Action
Divine actions are powers granted to characters by divine beings. Divine actions are distinctly different from spells, and are not bound by the same rules.
Divine actions can be obtained by the player through the power of prayer(s).

## Prayers
All [Zealot](classes.md#zealot) characters start with one prayer slot.
