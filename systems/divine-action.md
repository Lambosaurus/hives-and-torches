# Divine Action

Divine actions are powers granted to characters by divine beings. Divine actions are distinctly different from spells, and are not bound by the same rules.

Divine actions can be obtained by the player through the power of prayer(s).

Divine actions can be split into 2 groups: Miracles and Curses.
Miracles are usually have positive benefits to the recipient. Curses are usually bestowed upon enemies, and have negative effects.

A player can use their divine actions a number of times per long rest equal to 1 plus their [Zealot](classes.md#zealot) level.

## Orison

An Orison is a divine action that is always ready, and can be used just like any other divine action. By default all [Zealot](classes.md#zealot)s begin with [Minor Rejuvenation](#minor-rejuvenation). More Orisons can be granted through feats, or other acts (of faith) at the DM's discretion.
## Prayers

All [Zealot](classes.md#zealot) characters start with one prayer slot.
Each prayer has 3 tenets, each providing the character with a divine action.

A prayer also grants the character a passive ability.

## Prayer of Mercy
`Domain: General` `Domain: Healing` `Domain: Grave`
### Tenets

**Heal those in need**: Grant Miracle [Restore Wound](#restore-wound)
**Protect the weak**: Grant Miracle [Shield of Faith](#shield-of-faith)
**End their suffering**: Grant Curse [Path to the Grave](#path-to-the-grave)
### Passive

Your [Path to the Grave](#path-to-the-grave) deals 1 additional fatigue damage.

## Miracles

### Restore Wound

The target restores 1 wound
### Shield of Faith

The target gains your `Will / 2` bonus (round up) to their defence for the rest of combat
## Curses
### Path to the Grave
For the rest of the combat, whenever the target takes fatigue damage, add your [Will](stats.md#will) as bonus damage
