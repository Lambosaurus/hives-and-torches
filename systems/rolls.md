## Advantage

Advantage is a an additional `+1d4` that is added to your roll. These are given due to advantageous circumstances that improve your odds of succeeding your task. Advantage may stack indefintely, and is the opposite of [disadvantage](#Disadvantage).

Advantage and disadvantage cancel out before rolling. Ie, if you have 1x advantage and 3x disadvantage, you would add `-2d4` to your roll.

Advantage and disadvantage can be applied to **any** roll, at the DM's discretion.

## Disadvantage

Disadvantage is a `-1d4` that is added to your roll. See [advantage](#Advantage) for information on stacking.

## Tests

Tests are a roll that your character makes against a foe to perform some kind of action. This is done by comparing one of your [attributes](stats.md#Attributes) against an atribute of your foes.

Your score is formed by rolling `2d6` plus your characters atribute score. Your foes score is '7' plus their attribute score (the average value of their attribute). If your score equals or exceeds your foes score, you succeed the test. [Advantage](#Advantage) may also be added to these rolls.

If the foes attribute is unspecified, ie, "A strength test", then the tested attributes are the same, ie, strength vs strength.

### Example: "Strength test against Dexterity"

Your character has a strength of `+2`, so they roll `2d6 + 2` and get a score of `8`. The foes dexterity is `+1`, so their score is `7 + 1`. Because these scores are equal, you succeed the test.


# Attacks

Your attack consists of a single roll, your attack score. Your attack score is derived based on your chosen weapon, see the [melee](#Melee-attack) and [ranged](#Ranged-attack) sections. This will usually be two weapon dice plus an attribute. Any [advantage](#Advantage) dice should be rolled together with these.

Once the dice are rolled, these should be checked for [criticals](rolls#Crititals). These enable additional modifiers to the attack if present.

If the attack score is greater than the foes [defence](stats.md#Defence) score, then the attack is a hit, and the damage dealt is the difference. The DM is not required to reveal the defence score of the foe, or whether an attack did any damage.

### Example 1:
A character with a long sword (`d8`) and +3 strength makes a melee attack against foe. He rolls `2d8 + 3` and gets a combat score of `13`. The foe has a defence of `4`, so the damage dealt is `13 - 4 = 9`. This 

### Example 2:
A character with a short bow (`d6`) and +1 agility makes a ranged attack against a foe. He rolls `2d6 + 1` and gets a combat score of `3`. The foe has a defence of `5`, so the attack is inneffective and no damage is dealt.

## Melee attack

A melee attack is an attack with a [melee weapon](weapons.md#Melee-weapons). The target foe must within your weapon reach. Weapon reach is `5ft` unless otherwise stated. The attack score of a melee attack is `2x` your weapons dice plus your [strength](attributes.md#Strength).

## Ranged attack

A ranged attack is an attack made with a [ranged weapon](weapons.md#Ranged-weapons). The attack score of a ranged attack is `2x` your weapons dice plus your [agility](attributes.md#Agility). A ranged attack is [unsafe](actions.md#Unsafe).

## Unarmed attack

It is possible to make an attack without a weapon. This is equivalent to a [melee attack](#Melee-attack), however your attack score is only `1d4` plus your [strength](attributes.md#Strength).


# Criticals

Any dice with a duplicate number are considered a critical. These include any [advantage](#Advantage) dice. Notice how a few advantage die significantly increase your odds of achieving critical effects, and many advantage die may even guarantee a critical. Stacking advantage to improve the odds of critical is a core mechanic to this ruleset.

If you have a [disadvantage](#Disadvantage) (That is, more disadvantages than advantages) you are **not** elegable for criticals. You may instead be elegible for [critical failures](#Critical-failures). Critical failures occurr on duplicate dice, like regular criticals. Critical failures are ignored by default.

### Example 1:

A character performs a strength test. He rolls `2d6 + 1`.

## Critical hit

A critical hit is a [critital](Critical) that is rolled during an [attack](#Attack) action. This allows the character to select an applicable critical hit effect. All characters have the default option to use this effect to ignore [defence](stats.md#Defence) when calculating damage.

## Critical failures
