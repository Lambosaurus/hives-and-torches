Your maximum fatigue is based on [strength](#strength). If this characters strength modifier is negative, do **not** add strength.

 - At [level](#level) `1`, the base fatigue is `4 + 1d4` plus [strength](#strength)
 - Maximum fatigue increases by `1d4` plus [strength](#strength) on each subsequent level.
