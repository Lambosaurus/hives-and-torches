# Stealth
Stealth is a [finesse](./stats.md#finesse) [test](rolls.md#tests) against a foes [intellect](./stats.md#intellect). If multiple foes are available, the highest intellect should be used.

On a success, the character becomes [hidden](statuses.md#hidden).

> Note: The DM is not required to tell the characters if their roll is successful or not, but shoud describe how the foes do (or don't) react.

[Disadvantages](rolls.md#disadvantage) should be given to to stealth rolls for the following reasons:
 - If the character is not behind a form of cover.
 - If the character is performing a loud or hasty action.
 - The foe has enhanced senses: such as a hounds sense of smell, or the compound eyes of a spider.

It is ultimately up to the DM as to the number of disadvantages applied to these tests.

> Note: The DM may choose to deny the player a stealth roll entirely if enough factors are against them.
