# Martial Feats

## Dual Wielder
The user is experienced with handling two weapons at once, and this no longer impedes their ability to use their primary weapon.

When performing an [off hand attack](actions.md#off-hand-attack), the primary attack is no longer perfomed with [disadvantage](rolls.md#disadvantage).


## Dirty fighting
The character may perform the [trip](actions.md#trip) action in combat without becoming [unsafe](actions.md#unsafe-action) on failure.

Trip may also be used as an alternative [attack of opportunity](actions.md#attack-of-opportunity). On a successful trip, the foe looses its remaining movement, and may not take any other [move](actions.md#move) or [manoeuvre](actions.md#manoeuvre) actions this turn.
