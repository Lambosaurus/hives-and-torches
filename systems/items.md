# Items
Characters can collect an assortment of many items in their journeys. Here we list some examples, but the extent of what items can exist and how they are used is is for the players and DM to discover.

Items have the following attributes:

## Name
What the item is called

## Description
A description should include the items appearance, and any effects or special rules it has.

## Weight
How much of a physical burden the item is to carry. See [Encumbrance](stats.md#encumbrance)

## Value
The expected marketable value of this item, given normal circumstances.

> Note: This does not mean the item will be able to be sold or purchased for this amount, or will be sold at all



# Armor
Armor can be worn by characters to improve their [defence](stats.md#defence). These cannot be worn without the prerequisite [feat](feats.md#feats) or [class](classes.md). Only one set of armor can be work at once.
