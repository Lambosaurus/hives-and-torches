## Advantage

Advantage is a an additional `+1d4` that is added to your roll. These are given due to advantageous circumstances that improve your odds of succeeding your task. Advantage may stack indefintely, and is the opposite of [disadvantage](#Disadvantage).

Advantage and disadvantage cancel out before rolling. Ie, if you have 1x advantage and 3x disadvantage, you would add `-2d4` to your roll.

## Disadvantage

Disadvantage is a `-1d4` that is added to your roll. See [advantage](#Advantage) for information on stacking.

## Tests

Tests are a roll that your character makes against a foe to perform some kind of action. This is done by comparing one of your [attributes](stats#Attributes) against an atribute of your foes.

Your score is formed by rolling `2d6` plus your characters atribute score. Your foes score is the average value of their attribute, or `7` plus their attribute score. If your score equals or exceeds your foes score, you succeed the test.

If the foes attribute is unspecified, ie, "A strength test", then the tested attributes are the same, ie, strength vs strength.

### Example: "Strength test against Dexterity"

Your character has a strength of `+2`, so they roll `2d6 + 2` and get a score of `8`. The foes dexterity is `+1`, so their score is `7 + 1`. Because these scores are equal, you succeed the test.
