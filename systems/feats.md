# Martial Feats

## Dual Wielder
The user is experienced with handling two weapons at once, and this no longer impedes their ability to use their primary weapon.

When performing an [off hand attack](actions.md#Off-hand-attack), the primary attack is no longer perfomed with [disadvantage](rolls.md#Disadvantage).


## Off hand guard
The character may gain `+1` [armor](stats.md#Armor) while wielding a weapon in their off hand. 

## Trip
The character may perform a trip action in combat. This may be used as a secondary action, or as a reaction. The reaction must be triggered by a foe using the [move](actions.md#Move) action.

This allows the character to attempt to trip a foe in natural reach. Make a dexterity test against the foe. On success, the foe is [prone](statuses.md#prone), and any remaining movement the foe may have had is lost.
