
## Defence
Defence represents how capable a character is at protecting themselves from foes. This might be using quick footwork or heavy armor plating.

Base defence is [finesse](#Finesse) plus the bonuses of any worn [armor](items.md#Armor).
- Wearing [heavy armor](items.md#Heavy-armor) removes your [finesse](#Finesse) bonus.
- Defence may never be negative.

## Fatigue
Fatigue represents the wear and tear your character takes over the course of their adventure. Scrapes, bruises, aching muscles, and general exhaustion: these build up until the character is too tired to protect themselves from foes and the environment.

Your maximum fatigue is based on [strength](#Strength). If this characters strength modifier is negative, do **not** add strength.

 - At [level](#Level) `1`, the base fatigue is `4 + 1d4` plus [strength](#Strength)
 - Maximum fatigue increases by `1d4` plus [strength](#Strength) on each subsequent level.

The DM may choose to allow players to reroll `1`'s when rolling to add maximum fatigue.
