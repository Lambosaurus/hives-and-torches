# Items
Characters can collect an assortment of many items in their journeys. Here we list some examples, but the extent of what items can exist and how they are used is is for the players and DM to discover.

## General Template
Items normally define the following:

### Name
What the item is called

### Description
A description should include the items appearance, and any effects or special rules it has.

### Weight
How much of a physical burden the item is to carry. See [Encumbrance](../systems/stats.md#Encumbrance)

### Value
The expected marketable value of this item, given normal circumstances.
