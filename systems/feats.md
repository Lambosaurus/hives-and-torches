# Martial Feats

## Dual Wielder
The user is experienced with handling two weapons at once, and this no longer impedes their ability to use their primary weapon.

When performing an [off hand attack](actions.md#Off-hand-attack), the primary attack is no longer perfomed with [disadvantage](rolls.md#Disadvantage).


## Dirty fighting
The character may perform the [trip](actions.md#Trip) action in combat without becoming [unsafe](actions.md#Unsafe-action) on failure.

Trip may also be used as an alternative [attack of opportunity](actions#Attack-of-opportunity). On a successful trip, the foe looses its remaining movement, and may not take any other [move](actions.md#Move) or [manoeuvre](actions.md#Manoeuvre) actions this turn.
